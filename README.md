# til
Today I learned, keeping track of the many things I learn along the way.

## About
I thoughtfully stolen this idea, from [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til/tree/master) who was inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), who __'...shamelessly stole this idea from [thoughtbot/til.](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)' ðŸ˜‚. 

Technically I could just read all those TILs and have an endless supply of things I learned.

I won't these are my own. I mean I won't steal them. I will read them.

## Todo
- [ ] Set up github actions just like [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til/tree/master)
